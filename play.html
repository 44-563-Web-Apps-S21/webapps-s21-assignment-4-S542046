        It is a play that shows a good picture of woman’s lack of freedom. 
        It is a story of several couples about of which there is a fairy king, Oberon, who proves his dominion over the queen of the fairies.
        There was a conflict between Oberon and Titania about who should keep the Indian child, whose mother had died recently. 
        Titania does not want to give the child up but Oberon wants to make him a servant.
