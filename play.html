       Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place
       for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
       stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we
       will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.</p>

       There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
       Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
       draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
       cannot abide. How answer you that?</p>
      <h6 class="name snout"> SNOUT </h6>
      <p class="speech">
       By'r lakin, a parlous fear.</p>
       <h6 class="name starveling ">STARVELING</h6>
      <p class="speech"> I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.</p>
      <h6 class="name bottom"> BOTTOM</h6>
      <p class="speech">
       Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
       Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
       say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
       Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
       better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
       Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
       out of fear.</p>
       <h6 class="name quince">QUINCE</h6>
       <p class="speech">
       Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
       written in eight and six.</p>
