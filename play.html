       Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place
       for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
       stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we
       will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.</p>

      <p class="speech">
       Peter Quince,--</p>
      <h6 class="name Quince">QUINCE</h6>
      <p class="speech">
       What sayest thou, bully Bottom?</p>
       <h6 class="name BOTTOM">BOTTOM</h6>
      <p class="speech">
       There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
       Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
       draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
       cannot abide. How answer you that?</p>
      <h6 class="name snout"> SNOUT </h6>
      <p class="speech">
       By'r lakin, a parlous fear.</p>
       <h6 class="name starveling ">STARVELING</h6>
      <p class="speech"> I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.</p>
      <h6 class="name bottom"> BOTTOM</h6>
      <p class="speech">
       Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
       Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
       say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
       Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
       better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
       Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
       out of fear.</p>
       <h6 class="name quince">QUINCE</h6>
       <p class="speech">
       Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
       written in eight and six.</p>
       <h6 class="name bottom">BOTTOM</h6>
       <p class="speech">
       No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.</p>
       <h6 class="name snout">SNOUT</h6>
       <p class="speech">
       Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?</p>
       <h6 class ="name starveling">STARVELING</h6>
       <p class="speech">
       I fear it, I promise you.</p>
       <h6 class="name bottom">
       BOTTOM</h6>
       <p class="speech">
       Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
       bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
       most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
       wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
       look to 't.</p>
       <h6 class="name snout">SNOUT</h6>
       <p class="speech">
       Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.</p>
       <h6 class="name bottom">BOTTOM</h6>
       <p class="speech">
       Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
       be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
       must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
       defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
       You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
       entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
       for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
       were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
       man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
       his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.</p>
       <h6 class="name quince">QUINCE</h6>
      <P class="speech">
       Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
       that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,
       you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.</P>
       <h6 class ="name snout ">SNOUT</h6>
       SNOUT
       <p class="speech">
       Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?</p>
